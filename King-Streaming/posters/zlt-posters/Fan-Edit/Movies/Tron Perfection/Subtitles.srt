9
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,214
Good evening. Our lead story.

10
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:34,052
ENCOM CEO and video game icon
Kevin Flynn has disappeared.

11
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:37,180
He was best known for designing Tron
and Space Paranoids,

12
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,016
the two bestselling video games
in history.

13
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,269
Flynn took ownership of ENCOM
in 1982

14
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,731
as the company skyrocketed
to the top of the tech industry.

15
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:51,152
But things changed in 1985
with the untimely death of Flynn's wife,

16
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,738
the mother of his young son, Sam.

17
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,824
Recently, ENCOM board members

18
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,158
have been troubled by reports

19
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,203
of Flynn's erratic,
even obsessive, behavior.

20
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,998
With Flynn missing,
the company is now in chaos.

21
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,334
This afternoon, ENCOM's board

22
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,587
moved to seize control
from Flynn's partner, Alan Bradley,

23
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,674
vowing to return the company
to profitability.

24
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:17,971
Loyal to the end, Bradley maintains
his belief that Flynn is not missing

25
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,682
and is instead pursuing his dream of

26
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:24,227
"a digital frontier
to reshape the human condition."

27
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,771

most ardent supporters

28
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,232

29

Kevin Flynn may have simply
run away.

30
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,196
And while Flynn's loyalists
hope for his imminent return,

31
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:39,117
there is perhaps no one who wishes it
to happen more than young Sam Flynn,

32
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:43,329
now in the care of his grandparents,
and heir to an empire in turmoil.

I found them in here.
Like flowers in a wasteland.

368
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,858
They were spectacular.

369
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,777
Everything I'd hoped to find
in the system,

370
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,363
control, order, perfection,

371
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:50,823
none of it meant a thing.

372
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,199
I'd been living in a hall of mirrors.

373
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,327
SAM: So what happened?

374
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:59,999
KEVIN: Clu. Clu happened.

375
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:06,464
KEVIN: Tron, he fought for me.

376
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,640
I never saw him again.

377
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,896
Clu saw the ISOs as an imperfection.

378
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,858
So he destroyed them.
(DISTANT SCREAMING)

379
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,152
"The Purge."

380
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:32,823
- He killed them all?
- It was genocide.

381
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,994
I tried to get back
but I couldn't get to the portal.

382
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,165
It closed on me, Sam.

383
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,001
That's why I never came home.

384
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,593
SAM: So the portal...

385
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:53,677
It's open now.

386
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:54,970
KEVIN: Not for long.

387
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,681
Only one millicycle, about eight hours.

388
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:01,185
So we go now. Go home.
We make a run for it.

389
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,395
- We get you out of here.
- Don't rush.

390
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,648
What do you mean?
The portal's gonna close.

391
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,318
What? What is it?

392
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:13,489
The moment Flynn is on the Grid, Clu
will stop at nothing to obtain his disk.

393
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,368
Clu figures if I can be in...

394
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,161
SAM: He can be out?

395
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:22,790
KEVIN: With my disk, it's possible.
SAM: And then what?

396
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,167
Game over.

397
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,837
The guy doesn't dig imperfection.

398
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:34,093
So what do we do? Nothing?

399
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:37,096
It's amazing how productive
doing nothing can be.

400
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,808
Clu's planning something.
We've known that for a while.

401
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,601
Programs have been disappearing.

402
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,312
There's unrest out there,
even revolution.

403
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:49,608
If we sit tight, Clu might
be brought down from the inside.

404
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:53,028
SAM: If the portal is closing, we can't
sit around. We have to move now.

405
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:57,950
Tell me, what brought you here,
to the Grid?

406
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,452
Alan got your page.

407
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,289
I didn't send any page.

408
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,040
It was Clu.

409
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:08,002
Clu sent that page.
That's why you're here.

410
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,088
This is all his design.
He wanted a new piece

411
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:13,591
on the board to change the game!

412
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,759
With you, he got more
than he ever dreamed.

413
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:21,015
This is precisely what he wants.
Us together heading for the portal.

414
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:25,269
It's his game now.
The only way to win is not to play.

415
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,189
Well, that's a hell of a way to live.

416
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,609
Goodnight, Sam.

417
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,134
How can he be so afraid
of his own creation?

418
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:00,429
I mean, he built Clu.
Why doesn't he just end him?

419
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,766
He could,
but it would require reintegration.

420
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,351
Yeah, all right.

421
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:09,146
Flynn would never survive the event.
It would mean the end of them both.

422
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,732
I'm going through the portal.

423
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,567
Clu wants Flynn's disk, not mine.

424
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:17,821
I'm going to find Alan and we'll figure
this thing out from the other side.

425
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:22,034
This may be Clu's game here, but
in my world, he's gone in one keystroke.

426
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,412
But I can't do anything
unless I get to the portal.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

There's someone I once knew,

429

a program named Zuse
who fought alongside the ISOs.

430
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,292
They say he can get anyone anywhere.

431

432
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,801

01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:05,023
I came with a girl, a program.
Where is she?

01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:08,444
Sam!

735
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:37,139
- Why are you here?
- We gotta get to the flight deck.

Clu will be here any minute,
we'll never make it!

Whooh!

748
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:42,991

I had a feeling you'd be here!

(LAUGHS) The cycles
haven't been kind, have they?

761
01:21:30,635 --> 01:21:32,888
Oh, you don't look so bad.

762
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:37,767
I did everything.
Everything you ever asked.

763
01:21:38,351 --> 01:21:40,103
I know you did.

764
01:21:40,186 --> 01:21:43,481
- CLU: I executed the plan!
- As you saw it.

765
01:21:43,648 --> 01:21:48,778
You... You promised that we
would change the world together.

766
01:21:49,195 --> 01:21:51,323
- You broke your promise.
- I know.

767
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:52,949
I understand that now.

768
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:56,494
I took this system
to its maximum potential.

769
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:58,747
I created the perfect system!

770
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:02,584
The thing about perfection
is that it's unknowable.

771
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:07,088
You wouldn't know that
because I didn't when I created you.

772
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:10,592
I'm sorry, Clu.

773
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:15,138

Go!

Yeah.

01:25:45,431 --> 01:25:47,684
I need you at ENCOM at 8:00 a.m.

793
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:50,395
I'm taking the company back, Alan.
