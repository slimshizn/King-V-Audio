1
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,485
What's wrong with you?

2
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,164
You haven't answered my emails.

3
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,458
I can't tell you now.

4
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,169
Yes, you can.

5
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,633
Who is the caveman?

6
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,928
The man Grandfather wanted me to find.

7
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,265
You can't bring him in like that.

8
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,258
Yashida-sama.

9
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:55,851
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

10
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,340
<i>- Please, father!</i>
<i>- Quiet! </i>

11
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,258
<i>Wait, father.</i>
<i>Please, listen to me.</i>

12
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,260
Not now, Mariko.

13
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:03,264
- Plese, listen to me, Dad.
- Stop bothering me!

14
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,850
- Please, listen to me.
- I have no time for this.

15
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,645
- You must hear what Grandfather told me.
- I told you, shut up!

16
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:12,148
You just don't care!
That's why grandfather...

17
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,497
Don't look so sad, Shingen.

18
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,417
I'm still dying.

19
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:24,471
There is no easy way to say this.

20
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:30,268
But then, it's never been
easy for us, has it?

21
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,563
I have tried, father.

22
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,149
You've done the best you can.

23
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,847
You're not making sense, Father...

24
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,315
That will never happen.

25
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,745
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

26
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,642
This cowardly attack was...

27
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,769
the work of Yakuza thugs.

28
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:48,023
A violent response to my efforts...

29
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:51,443
to crack down on organized crime.

30
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:56,365
They exited the North Gate.

31
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,493
She was with the stranger--

32
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:51,551
Our island is long and thin.

33
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:54,095
Trains only run in two directions.

34
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,222
I assure you Lord Shingen...

35
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,266
my officers are making every effort--

36
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,268
Then they're idiots.

37
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,437
You've wasted enough of my time.

38
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,315
I have my father's affairs to attend to.

39
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,444
Get out and find her!

40
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,270
If the Yakuza got
into the funeral...

41
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:45,855
they had someone inside.

42
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:48,525
They'll never find me here.

43
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,361
You're not safe.

44
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,197
I'm coming down there.

45
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:55,782
They'll follow you.

46
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,450
Please.

47
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,119
Wait a few days.

48
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,621
Please. I'm fine.

49
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:03,498
Logan's here.

50
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,708
He's wounded, Mariko.

51
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:08,628
Someone's here.

52
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,380
I have to go.

53
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:17,637
A tree fell on the road.

54
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:20,974
The men could use some help.

55
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:47,980
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

56
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:07,336
Come on!

57
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:48,914
Did you know I studied
biology in college?

58
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:52,376
Genetics.

59
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,757
There are genes that skip generations.

60
01:17:59,299 --> 01:18:01,093
Recessive genes.

61
01:18:03,887 --> 01:18:04,721
Eyes.

62
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:05,806
Eyes. Hair.

63
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:08,392
Talent.

64
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:11,269
Temperament.

65
01:18:13,438 --> 01:18:16,650
Not every child gets the same.

66
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:19,569
My father saw little of himself in me.

67
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,280
But in you...

68
01:18:22,739 --> 01:18:25,075
he faced a mirror.

69
01:18:44,594 --> 01:18:46,096
How did you convince my father...

70
01:18:46,304 --> 01:18:47,764
to award you control...

71
01:18:47,931 --> 01:18:49,433
of Asia's largest corporation?

72
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:51,309
You've gone insane.

73
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:54,646
I'm just waking up.

74
01:18:55,647 --> 01:18:57,149
If you kill me, you will lose...

75
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,025
what little honor you have left.

76
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:01,945
I don't want to hurt you.

77
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,447
I want to help you.

78
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:05,323
Help you end your pain...

79
01:19:05,615 --> 01:19:06,783
what that mutant stopped you...

80
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,285
from doing last week.

81
01:19:08,493 --> 01:19:10,662
I never wanted to die, Father.

82
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:14,250
You are my only family.

83
01:35:15,835 --> 01:35:18,170
Be well, sister.
